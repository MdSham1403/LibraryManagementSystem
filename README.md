# LibraryManagementSystem

Project Title: Library Management System

Description:
The Library Management System is a Python-based web application that provides an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing a library's resources and services. This project combines Python, SQL, and web development to create a comprehensive library management system with features for both librarians and library patrons.

Key Features:

User Registration and Authentication: Allows librarians to create and manage user accounts, while patrons can log in and access their accounts.

Book Management: Provides librarians with tools to add, update, and delete books, including information like title, author, ISBN, and available copies.

Borrowing and Returning: Patrons can borrow books and return them, with the system keeping track of due dates and late fees.

Search and Filtering: Users can search for books using various criteria, such as title, author, or category, and see the availability of each book.

User Privileges: Differentiates between librarian and patron accounts, granting librarians administrative rights for book management.

Database Storage: Utilizes a SQL database to store book and user information securely.

Technologies Used:

Python: The primary programming language for the backend logic and routing.
Flask: A web framework used to create the web application.
SQLAlchemy: For interfacing with the SQLite database.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Front-end technologies for the user interface.
Plotly: For generating interactive expense reports in the Expense Tracker.
Getting Started:

Clone the project repository.
